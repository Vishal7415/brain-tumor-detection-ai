# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model for classifying brain tumors from MRI images. Using custom preprocessing and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model predicts one of four categories: **glioma**, **meningioma**, **pituitary tumor**, or **no tumor**.
